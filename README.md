# Chico Framework

## WIP

This project is work in progress, is incomplete and may change sharply.

As long as I don't remove this ad, it will remain at this status, there's also no guarantee that I will finish it.

## About

Chico is a micro framework oriented to offer the minimum viable product to start a Web/API project.

I'm creating Chico mainly to use it as a base in my own projects, where due to various practices and methodologies
that I follow I prefer to attach the minimum to any piece of software that is not part of the project itself.

Other frameworks which I have worked with, such as Laravel or Symfony, tend to mark your entire project with its
essence, influencing its architecture and adding its limitations.

I also want to get out of my comfort zone, there are many things a programmer should be able to do but have never done.
This is so in my case and I want to put myself to the test.

## The name

I was looking for a word that refers to the main objective of my framework, which is to be small and light. Words that
refer to small sizes, like yocto, zepto, pico, nano, micro... are taken by hundreds of projects.

So I opted to use the word *chico* (from Spanish), what does it mean?

In Spain the main use of *chico* is to refer to a boy. In some places it's used to refer to little things too. The word
amuses me and belongs to my land, so I decided to use it.

## Roadmap and Features

What I usually look in a framework are mainly these things and this is my progress:

- [x] Router
- [ ] Dependency Resolver
- [ ] Boilerplate

## Using

If you decide to use Chico in your projects, I would like you to know that as a personal project I don't seek to give
it stability or support to other people needs.

If you really want to use it, it may be recommended that you fork and work on your own repository, so the sudden changes
that I can make will not affect you.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, keep in mind that it's designed under my criteria and to solve my own needs.

Still you are free to create as many issues and pull requests as you want, I will be happy to review your requests,
suggestions and changes. It could be a good opportunity for us to learn something new!
