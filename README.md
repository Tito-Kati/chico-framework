# Chico Framework

## WIP

This project is work in progress and therefore is incomplete and will change sharply.

As long as I don't remove this ad, it will remain at this status and there is no guarantee
that I will remove it at some point.

## About

Chico Framework is a micro framework (what a surprise!, another framework?) strongly oriented to offer the minimum
viable product to be able to start any project.

I am creating this framework mainly for two reasons:

The first is to use it as a base in my own projects, where due to various practices and methodologies that I follow, I prefer to attach the minimum to any piece of software that is not part of the project itself.

Other frameworks with which I have worked intensively, such as Laravel and Symfony, tend to mark your entire project with its essence, ending up completely influencing its architecture and limitations.

The second is to get out of my comfort zone, there are many things that in principle an experienced programmer is capable of programming but has never programmed.

In my case, the two pieces that are going to form this framework are two of these things that in principle I am capable of developing but I have never done it and I want to put myself to the test.

## The name

I was looking for a word that refers to the main objective of my framework, which is to be small and light.

Surprisingly, cool words that refer to small sizes like Yocto, Zepto, Pico, Nano, Micro... are taken! There really are
hundreds of frameworks and projects that use these words in their names!

So I opted to use a quirky word, *chico*, but, what does *chico* mean?

Well, in Spain the main use of *chico* is to refer to a boy. But in some places it is used to refer to little things,
being a kind of diminutive of the word *chiquito*, which is used in some places to refer to a small child or directly
to something very small.

The word amuses me and belongs to my land, so I decided to use it.

## Roadmap

What I usually look in a framework are mainly 3 things, these are and this is my progress:

- [x] Router
- [ ] Dependency Resolver
- [ ] Boilerplate

## Using

If for any reason you like what you see and decide to use it in your own projects, I would like you to know that as a
personal project I do not seek to give stability or support to other people.

If you really like to use it in a project that is important to you, it may be recommended that you fork and work on your
own repository, so that the sudden changes it can make will not affect you in a negative way.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute more of the same happens, in principle it is designed under my criteria and to solve my own
needs.

Still you are free to create as many issues and pull requests as you want, I will be happy to review your requests,
suggestions and changes. It could be a very good opportunity for one of us to learn something new!
